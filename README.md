AI Resume Analyzer is a smart resume evaluation tool designed to help job seekers and recruiters assess resumes with clarity and precision.  
The application analyzes resume content using natural language processing and AI-driven logic to provide **structured insights, skill alignment, and improvement suggestions**.

The focus of the project is to transform resumes from static documents into **actionable, data-backed profiles**.

## Product Overview

The Resume Analyzer evaluates resumes against industry expectations and role-specific requirements.  
Instead of simply parsing content, it highlights **strengths, gaps, and optimization opportunities** in a clear and structured manner.

Results are presented using a **calm, professional color system**:
- Green for strengths and matches
- Amber for partial alignment
- Red for missing or weak areas
- Neutral tones for informational feedback

---

## Core Capabilities

- Resume content extraction and normalization
- Skill detection and categorization
- Role relevance scoring
- ATS compatibility analysis
- Keyword and section completeness checks
- Actionable improvement suggestions
- Structured feedback instead of raw AI output

---

## AI & Analysis Approach

The analyzer uses AI and NLP techniques to:

- Understand resume context beyond keyword matching
- Identify implicit skills and experience patterns
- Evaluate section balance (skills, experience, projects, education)
- Detect overuse, underuse, or absence of critical keywords
- Generate targeted recommendations aligned with hiring standards

The system prioritizes **explainable results** over opaque scoring.

## Resume Scoring Logic

Resumes are evaluated across multiple dimensions, such as:

- Skill relevance
- Experience alignment
- Formatting and structure
- Keyword density and placement
- ATS readability

Each dimension contributes to an overall score, supported by **clear reasoning**, not just numbers.

---

## User Experience Philosophy

The UI is designed to feel like a professional hiring tool:

- Minimalist layout with strong visual hierarchy
- Soft neutral backgrounds to reduce cognitive load
- Color-coded insights for quick scanning
- Clear separation between analysis and suggestions
- No clutter, no overwhelming AI jargon

The goal is to make resume feedback **useful, readable, and trustworthy**.

## Responsible AI Use
